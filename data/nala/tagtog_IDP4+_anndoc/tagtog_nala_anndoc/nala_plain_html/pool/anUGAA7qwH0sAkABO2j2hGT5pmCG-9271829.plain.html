          <p id="s1p1">Three newly identified A*24 alleles: A*2406, A*2413 and A*2414.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Three previously unknown A24-related alleles were identified by PCR-SSO typing and confirmed by DNA sequencing in Australian Aboriginal populations (A*2406, 2413) and in individuals of South American descent (A*2414). A*2406 and A*2413 both have two adjacent (but different) nucleotide substitutions in codon 156 in exon 3 compared to A*2402, resulting in a single amino acid replacement in each allele. The South American A*2414 is apparently a hybrid between A2 and A24 with a segment of the A*24 sequence between codons 95 and 107 in exon 3 replaced with the A*02 sequence. Interallelic sequence exchange is the most likely mechanism in the generation of all three novel alleles. Compared to A*2402, the four amino acid substitutions in the A*2414 molecule would be expected to significantly change the shape of the peptide binding cleft, leading to selection of different peptide ligands. The single amino acid replacements in position 156 of the two Australian Aboriginal A*24 alleles may also have significant functional effects. In particular, Trp replacing Gln in position 156 (A*2406) is predicted to markedly reduce the volume of the peptide binding cleft, influence the interaction of HLA pockets with peptide side chains, and therefore, cause major changes in peptide presentation. These newly defined alleles may reflect the adaptive process of HLA genes to local environments.</p>
