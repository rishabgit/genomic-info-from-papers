          <p id="s1p1">Analysis of multiple mutations in the hALG6 gene in a patient with congenital disorder of glycosylation Ic.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Congenital disorder of glycosylation Ic is caused by mutations in the hALG6 gene that encodes an alpha-1,3 glucosyltransferase. This enzyme is required for the addition of the first glucose residue to the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor for N-linked glycosylation. Here we describe the biochemical and molecular analysis of a patient with three mutations in the hALG6 gene. The maternal allele has an intronic G --&gt; A mutation resulting in skipping of exon3 (IVS3 + 5G &gt; A). This produces a nonfunctional enzyme as shown by its inability to restore normal glycosylation in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking a functional ALG6. The paternal allele has two mutations. One is a deletion of three bases (895-897delATA) leading to an in-frame deletion of isoleucine 299 (delI299) located in a transmembrane domain. The second mutation on the same allele 911T &gt; C causes a F304S change. When expressed in the ALG6 deficient yeast strain, this allele restores glycosylation but the mRNA is unstable or inefficiently transcribed, contributing to the impaired glycosylation in the patient.</p>
