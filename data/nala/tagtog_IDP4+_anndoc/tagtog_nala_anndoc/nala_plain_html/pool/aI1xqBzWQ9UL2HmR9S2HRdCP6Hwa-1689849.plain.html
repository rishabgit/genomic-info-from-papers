          <p id="s1p1">cDNA sequence for human erythrocyte ankyrin.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">The cDNA for human erythrocyte ankyrin has been isolated from a series of overlapping clones obtained from a reticulocyte cDNA library. The composite cDNA sequence has a large open reading frame of 5636 base pairs (bp) with the complete coding sequence for a polypeptide of 1879 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 206 kDa. The derived amino acid sequence contained 194 residues that were identical to those obtained by direct amino acid sequencing of 11 ankyrin proteolytic peptides. The primary sequence contained 23 highly homologous repeat units of 33 amino acids within the 90-kDa band 3 binding domain. Two cDNA clones showed evidence of apparent mRNA processing, resulting in the deletions of 486 bp and 135 bp, respectively. The 486-bp deletion resulted in the removal of a 16-kDa highly acidic peptide, and the smaller deletion had the effect of altering the COOH terminus of the molecule. Radiolabeled ankyrin cDNAs recognized two erythroid message sizes by RNA blot analysis, one of which was predominantly associated with early erythroid cell types. An ankyrin message was also observed in RNA from the human cerebellum by the same method. The ankyrin gene is assigned to chromosome 8 using genomic DNA from a panel of sorted human chromosomes.</p>
