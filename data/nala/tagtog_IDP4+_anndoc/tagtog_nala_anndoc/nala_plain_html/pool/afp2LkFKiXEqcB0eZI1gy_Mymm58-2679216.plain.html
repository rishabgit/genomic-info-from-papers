          <p id="s1p1">Nucleotide sequence of the ADH2(3) gene encoding the human alcohol dehydrogenase beta 3 subunit.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">All nine exons of the ADH2(3) allele, which encodes the human alcohol dehydrogenase beta 3 subunit, have been cloned and sequenced. Comparison of this sequence to the ADH2(1) nucleotide sequence revealed only a single difference that results in an amino acid change, thus proving that the significant kinetic differences between these two isozymes is due to the Cys for Arg substitution at position 369. There are also two silent polymorphisms, and two changes in noncoding regions.</p>
