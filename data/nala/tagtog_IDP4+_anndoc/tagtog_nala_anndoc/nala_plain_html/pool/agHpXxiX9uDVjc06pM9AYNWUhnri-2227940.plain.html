          <p id="s1p1">Molecular characterisation of two alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency variants: proteinase inhibitor (Pi) Null(Newport) (Gly115----Ser) and (Pi) Z Wrexham (Ser-19----Leu).</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Two single point mutations in the alpha-1-antitrypsin gene, resulting in AAT deficiency, have been characterised in heterozygotes by DNA amplification and direct sequencing. The mutations result in amino acid substitutions, Gly115----Ser and Ser-19----Leu, in the leader sequence, respectively, and have been designated Pi Null(Newport) and Pi Z Wrexham. In the two families studied the mutations occur on chromosomes which also carry the common mutation causing Z deficiency. Individuals with such a deficiency are, therefore, compound heterozygotes. It is not known if these particular mutations would only cause a mild form of AAT deficiency in the absence of the Z mutation as they do not appear to cause predictable folding abnormalities. They do, however, result in severe deficiency when the Z mutation occurs in the same gene.</p>
