          <p id="s1p1">Molecular basis of medium chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. An A to G transition at position 985 that causes a lysine-304 to glutamate substitution in the mature protein is the single prevalent mutation.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">We sequenced polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified variant medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) cDNAs in cultured fibroblasts from three MCAD-deficient patients. In all three patients, an A to G transition was identified at position 985 of the coding region. Since no appropriate restriction sites for detecting this point mutation were found, we devised a PCR method that amplifies an 87-bp fragment from position 955. In the 5' primer encompassing positions 955 to 984, A-981 was artificially substituted with C. With the presence of C-981 and G-985, an Nco I restriction site is introduced in the mutant copies. When cDNA or genomic DNA from fibroblasts of nine MCAD-deficient patients were tested with this method, the copies from all of them completely cleaved into two shorter fragments by Nco I, indicating their homozygosity for the A----G-985 transition. In contrast, the copies from all eight controls remained intact. Thus, this A----G-985 transition is the single prevalent mutation causing MCAD deficiency, a highly unusual feature for any genetic disorder. The PCR/Nco I digestion method is suitable for the diagnosis of MCAD deficiency.</p>
