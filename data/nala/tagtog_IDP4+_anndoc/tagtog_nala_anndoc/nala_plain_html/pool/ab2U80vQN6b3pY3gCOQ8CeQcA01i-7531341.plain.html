          <p id="s1p1">Congenital myasthenic syndrome caused by prolonged acetylcholine receptor channel openings due to a mutation in the M2 domain of the epsilon subunit.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">In a congenital myasthenic syndrome with a severe endplate myopathy, patch-clamp studies revealed markedly prolonged acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel openings. Molecular genetic analysis of AChR subunit genes demonstrated a heterozygous adenosine-to-cytosine transversion at nucleotide 790 in exon 8 of the epsilon-subunit gene, predicting substitution of proline for threonine at codon 264 and no other mutations in the entire coding sequences of genes encoding the alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon subunits. Genetically engineered mutant AChR expressed in a human embryonic kidney fibroblast cell line also exhibited markedly prolonged openings in the presence of agonist and even opened in its absence. The Thr-264--&gt;Pro mutation in the epsilon subunit involves a highly conserved residue in the M2 domain lining the channel pore and is likely to disrupt the putative M2 alpha-helix. Our findings indicate that a single mutation at a critical site can greatly alter AChR channel kinetics, leading to a congenital myasthenic syndrome. This observation raises the possibility that mutations involving subunits of other ligand-gated channels may also exist and be the basis of various other neurologic or psychiatric disorders.</p>
