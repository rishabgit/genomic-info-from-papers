          <p id="s1p1">Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta peptide 25-35 inhibits lipid peroxidation as a result of its membrane interactions.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">The biological activity of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid beta protein may be related to modulation of membrane lipid peroxidation. The effect of amyloid beta protein fragment 25-35 [A beta(25-35)] on lipid peroxidation was examined in liposomes enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids. The activity of A beta(25-35) was compared to that of A beta(25-35) with either a scrambled sequence [A beta(25-35)scram] or a peptide sequence in which methionine was replaced with leucine [A beta(25-35) met]. A beta(25-35) inhibited lipid peroxidation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The antioxidant activity of A beta(25-35) was observed at concentrations as low as 10 nM. The relative antioxidant activities of the amyloid beta protein fragments were as follows: A beta(25-35) &gt; A beta(25-35) met &gt; A beta(25-35)scram. The two more potent peptides intercalated into the membrane hydrocarbon core, as determined by small-angle x-ray diffraction approaches. These findings indicate that the amphiphilic A beta(25-35) peptide inhibits lipid peroxidation at low concentrations as a result of physicochemical interactions with the membrane lipid bilayer.</p>
