          <p id="s1p1">A missense mutation in the FALDH gene identified in Sjögren-Larsson syndrome patients originating from the northern part of Sweden.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital ichthyosis, spastic di- or tetraplegia, and mental retardation. SLS has been reported to occur in many populations but the highest incidence is in the north of Sweden. The gene causing SLS encodes a fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). In the present study, a point mutation in exon 7 of the FALDH gene was found in SLS patients of northern Swedish origin. The mutation consists of a C-to-T exchange at nucleotide position 943 in the cDNA. As a consequence, a highly conserved proline is replaced by a serine. The mutation was found in 49 out of 58 affected chromosomes and could be the most widely spread SLS mutation in the world.</p>
