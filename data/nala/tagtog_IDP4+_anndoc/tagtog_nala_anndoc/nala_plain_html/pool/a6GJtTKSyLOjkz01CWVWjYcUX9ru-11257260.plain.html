          <p id="s1p1">A point mutation in ABC1 gene in a patient with severe premature coronary heart disease and mild clinical phenotype of Tangier disease.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">The proband is a 50 year-old woman born from a consanguineous marriage. She has been suffering from angina pectoris since the age of 38 and underwent coronary bypass surgery for three-vessel disease at 48. The presence of low plasma levels of total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (2.4 and 0.1 mmol/l) and apo AI (&lt;15 mg/dl), associated with corneal lesions and a mild splenomegaly suggested the diagnosis of Tangier disease. However, none of the other features of Tangier disease, including hepatomegaly, anemia and peripheral neuropathy, were present. The analysis of the dinucleotide microsatellites located in chromosome 9q31 region demonstrated that the proband was homozygous for the alleles of D9S53, D9S1784 and D9S1832. The mother and son of the proband, both with low levels of HDL cholesterol, shared one of the proband's haplotypes, whereas neither of these haplotypes was present in the normolipidemic proband's sister. The sequence of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABC1-1) cDNA obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of total RNA isolated from cultured fibroblasts showed that the proband was homozygous for a C&gt;T transition in exon 13, which caused a tryptophane for arginine substitution (R527W). This mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing of exon 13 amplified from genomic DNA. It can be easily screened, as the nucleotide change introduces a restriction site for the enzyme Afl III. R527W substitution occurs in a highly conserved region of the NH2 cytoplasmic domain of ABC1 protein. R527W co-segregates with the low HDL phenotype in the family and was not found in 200 chromosomes from normolipidemic individuals.</p>
