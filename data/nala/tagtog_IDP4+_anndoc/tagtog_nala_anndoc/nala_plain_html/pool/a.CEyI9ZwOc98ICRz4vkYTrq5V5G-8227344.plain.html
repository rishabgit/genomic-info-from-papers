          <p id="s1p2">We examined the genetic basis for adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in seven patients with late/delayed onset of immunodeficiency, an underdiagnosed and relatively unstudied condition. Deoxyadenosine-mediated metabolic abnormalities were less severe than in the usual, early-onset disorder. Six patients were compound heterozygotes; 7 of 10 mutations found were novel, including one deletion (delta 1019-1020), three missense (Arg156 &gt; His, Arg101 &gt; Leu, Val177 &gt; Met), and three splicing defects (IVS 5, 5'ss T+6 &gt; A; IVS 10, 5'ss G+1 &gt; A; IVS 10, 3'ss G-34 &gt; A). Four of the mutations generated stop signals at codons 131, 321, 334, and 348; transcripts of all but the last, due to delta 1019-1020, were severely reduced. delta 1019-1020 (like delta 955-959, found in one patient and apparently recurrent) is at a short deletional hot spot. Arg156 &gt; His, the product of which had detectable activity, was found in three patients whose second alleles were unlikely to yield active ADA. The oldest patient diagnosed was homozygous for a single base change in intron 10, which activates a cryptic splice acceptor, resulting in a protein with 100 extra amino acids. We speculate that this &quot;macro ADA,&quot; as well as the Arg156 &gt; His, Arg101 &gt; Leu, Ser291 &gt; Leu, and delta 1019-1020 products, may contribute to mild phenotype. Tissue-specific variation in splicing efficiency may also ameliorate disease severity in patients with splicing mutations.</p>
