          <p id="s1p1">Molecular properties and pharmacogenetics of a polymorphism of adenylyl cyclase type 9 in asthma: interaction between beta-agonist and corticosteroid pathways.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">In asthma, the response to beta-agonists acting at beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2AR) displays extensive interindividual variation. One effector for airway beta2AR, adenylyl cyclase type 9 (AC9), was considered a candidate locus for predicting beta-agonist efficacy in the absence and presence of corticosteroid treatment. One non-synonymous AC9 polymorphism has been identified, which results in substitution of Met for Ile at amino acid 772. Under standard culture conditions in stably transfected cells, we found decreased catalytic activity of Met772. However, cells cultured in the presence of glucocorticoid expressing Met772 had a significantly increased albuterol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase response (approximately 80%) when compared with those expressing Ile772 (approximately 20%, P=0.02). An equivalent increase in beta2AR expression was observed in both lines due to glucocorticoid, but AC9 expression was unaffected. The hypothesis that Met772-AC9 is associated with an improved albuterol bronchodilator response in asthmatics was investigated in 436 asthmatic children who were followed for 4 years and randomized to receive placebo or the inhaled corticosteroid budesonide. Met772 carriers on budesonide showed a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (P=0.005). Moreover, a highly significant interaction (P=0.002) was found for budesonide treatment and the AC9 polymorphism. These in vitro and human association studies are consistent with this AC9 polymorphism altering albuterol responsiveness in the context of concomitant inhaled corticosteroid administration, which is a common asthma regimen. The Met772-AC9 polymorphism represents one of most likely several multi-gene polymorphisms along the receptor-relaxation axis, which together may provide for a composite pharmacogenetic index for asthma therapy.</p>
