          <p id="s1p1">Identification of human phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3) as N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate mutase (AGM1).</p>
          <p id="s1p2">We performed phenotyping of human phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM(3)) and screening for mutations in the human N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate mutase gene (AGM(1)) to identify PGM(3) as AGM(1). By sequencing the coding region of AGM(1), two alleles containing a G or A base at nucleotide 1396, that can respectively encode aspartic acid or asparagine at codon 466, were identified. Cell extracts of COS7 cells after transfection with the pcDNA 3.1(+) plasmid containing an AGM(1) allele with 1396G or 1396A showed similar electrophoretic patterns to the PGM(3) 1 or PGM(3) 2 protein, respectively, with the isozyme detection method used for PGM(3) phenotyping. The genotypes determined by the two alleles of AGM(1) coincided exactly with the PGM(3) phenotypes in 20 individuals. We also investigated the allele frequency of the AGM(1) nucleotide polymorphism in a Japanese population by DNA sequencing and found that the frequencies of alleles 1396G and 1396A were similar to previously reported PGM(3) *1 and PGM(3) *2 frequencies. Overall, the facts that the AGM(1) gene product shows PGM activity, AGM(1) is polymorphic, the electrophoretic mobility is similar between AGM(1) allele-specific products and PGM(3) 1 and 2 proteins, PGM(3) phenotypes and AGM(1) genotypes completely coincide in 20 individuals, and AGM(1) allele frequencies are similar to those of PGM(3) *1 and PGM(3) *2 in Japanese populations, suggest that PGM(3) is identical to AGM(1).</p>
