          <p id="s1p1">Early-onset Alzheimer's disease caused by mutations at codon 717 of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">A mutation at codon 717 of the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene has been found to cosegregate with familial Alzheimer's disease in a single family. This mutation has been reported in a further five out of approximately 100 families multiply affected by Alzheimer's disease. We have identified another family, F19, in which we have detected linkage between the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene and Alzheimer's disease. Direct sequencing of exon 17 in affected individuals from this family has revealed a base change producing a Val----Gly substitution, also at codon 717. The occurrence of a second allelic variant at codon 717 linked to the Alzheimer's phenotype supports the hypothesis that they are pathogenic mutations.</p>
