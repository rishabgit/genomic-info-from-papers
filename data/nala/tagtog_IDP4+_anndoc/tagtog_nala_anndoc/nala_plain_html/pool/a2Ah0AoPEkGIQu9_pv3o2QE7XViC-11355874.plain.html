          <p id="s1p1">Human ABCA1 contains a large amino-terminal extracellular domain homologous to an epitope of Sjögren's Syndrome.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">ABCA1 has been suggested to play a key role in cellular lipid release from peripheral cells. In order to study structure-function relationship of this protein, the protein product of a full-length human ABCA1 cDNA was examined for its functions and topological orientation. The electrophoretic mobilities of human ABCA1 expressed in transfected cells increased when treated with N-glycosidase F, suggesting that ABCA1 is highly glycosylated. The ABCA1 was photoaffinity-labeled with ATP and mediated the apoA-I-dependent-release of cholesterol and phospholipid. The influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was introduced into the amino-terminus (N-HA) or between the residues 207 and 208 (207-HA) of the protein. While an antibody against the C-terminus peptide of ABCA1 detected both fusion proteins, an anti-HA antibody did not react with the N-HA fusion protein. Confocal microscopy demonstrated strong cell surface signal with the anti-HA antibody of nonpermeabilized HEK293 cells expressing the 207-HA fusion protein. The results suggested that the signal peptide in the amino-terminal region is cleaved off in its mature form and that the following large hydrophilic region is exposed to outside of cells unlike previously proposed models. We found that this amino-terminal extracellular domain contains a segment homologous to the autoantigen SS-N, an epitope of Sjögren's syndrome, and further identified that ABCA7 codes for the autoantigen SS-N.</p>
