          <p id="s1p2">The ADAM (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) family of cell-surface proteins may have an important role in cellular interactions and in modulating cellular responses. In this report we describe a novel, secreted form of human ADAM 12 (meltrin alpha), designated ADAM 12-S (S for short), and a larger, membrane-bound form designated ADAM 12-L (L for long form). These two forms arise by alternative splicing of a single gene located on chromosome 10q26. Northern blotting demonstrated that mRNAs of both forms are abundant in human term placenta and are also present in some tumor cell lines. The ADAM 12-L transcript can also be detected in normal human adult skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. Human A204 embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells that do not differentiate into muscle cells and do not express any form of ADAM 12 were stably transfected with an ADAM 12-S minigene encoding the disintegrin domain, the cysteine-rich domain, and the unique 34 amino acid carboxyl terminus. Nude mouse tumors derived from these transfected cells contained ectopic muscle cells of apparent mouse origin as shown by species-specific markers. These results may have potential applications in the development of muscle-directed gene and cell therapies.</p>
