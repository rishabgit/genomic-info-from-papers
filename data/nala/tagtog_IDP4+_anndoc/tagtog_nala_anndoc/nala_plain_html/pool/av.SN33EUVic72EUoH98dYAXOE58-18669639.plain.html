          <p id="s1p1">Enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of mitogen-activated protein kinase p38alpha in different phosphorylation states.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are essential signaling molecules that mediate many cellular effects of growth factors, cytokines, and stress stimuli. Full activation of the MAP kinases requires dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TXY motif of the activation loop by MAP kinase kinases. Down-regulation of MAP kinase activity can be initiated by multiple serine/threonine phosphatases, tyrosine-specific phosphatases, and dual specificity phosphatases (MAP kinase phosphatases). This would inevitably lead to the formation of monophosphorylated MAP kinases. However, the biological functions of these monophosphorylated MAP kinases are currently not clear. In this study, we have prepared MAP kinase p38alpha, a member of the MAP kinase family, in all phosphorylated forms and characterized their biochemical properties. Our results indicated the following: (i) p38alpha phosphorylated at both Thr-180 and Tyr-182 was 10-20-fold more active than p38alpha phosphorylated at Thr-180 only, whereas p38alpha phosphorylated at Tyr-182 alone was inactive; (ii) the dual-specific MKP5, the tyrosine-specific hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and the serine/threonine-specific PP2Calpha are all highly specific for the dephosphorylation of p38alpha, and the dephosphorylation rates were significantly affected by different phosphorylated states of p38alpha; (iii) the N-terminal domain of MPK5 has no effect on enzyme catalysis, whereas deletion of the MAP kinase-binding domain in MKP5 leads to a 370-fold decrease in k(cat)/K(m) for the dephosphorylation of p38alpha. This study has thus revealed the quantitative contributions of phosphorylation of Thr, Tyr, or both to the activation of p38alpha and to the substrate specificity for various phosphatases.</p>
