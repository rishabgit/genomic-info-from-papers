          <p id="s1p1">Pias1 interaction and sumoylation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 8.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Group III presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play a central role in regulating presynaptic activity through G-protein effects on ion channels and signal transducing enzymes. Like all Class C G-protein-coupled receptors, mGluR8 has an extended intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD) presumed to allow for modulation of downstream signaling. In a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult rat brain cDNA library with the CTDs of mGluR8a and 8b (mGluR8-C) as baits, we identified sumo1 and four different components of the sumoylation cascade (ube2a, Pias1, Piasgamma, Piasxbeta) as interacting proteins. Binding assays using recombinant GST fusion proteins confirmed that Pias1 interacts not only with mGluR8-C but also with all group III mGluR CTDs. Pias1 binding to mGluR8-C required a region N-terminal to a consensus sumoylation motif and was not affected by arginine substitution of the conserved lysine 882 within this motif. Co-transfection of fluorescently tagged mGluR8a-C, sumo1, and enzymes of the sumoylation cascade into HEK293 cells showed that mGluR8a-C can be sumoylated in vivo. Arginine substitution of lysine 882 within the consensus sumoylation motif, but not other conserved lysines within the CTD, abolished in vivo sumoylation. Our results are consistent with post-translational sumoylation providing a novel mechanism of group III mGluR regulation.</p>
