          <p id="s1p1">Unusual phenotypic alteration of beta amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) maturation by a new Val-715 --&gt; Met betaAPP-770 mutation responsible for probable early-onset Alzheimer's disease.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">We have identified a novel beta amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) mutation (V715M-betaAPP770) that cosegregates with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a pedigree. Unlike other familial AD-linked betaAPP mutations reported to date, overexpression of V715M-betaAPP in human HEK293 cells and murine neurons reduces total Abeta production and increases the recovery of the physiologically secreted product, APPalpha. V715M-betaAPP significantly reduces Abeta40 secretion without affecting Abeta42 production in HEK293 cells. However, a marked increase in N-terminally truncated Abeta ending at position 42 (x-42Abeta) is observed, whereas its counterpart x-40Abeta is not affected. These results suggest that, in some cases, familial AD may be associated with a reduction in the overall production of Abeta but may be caused by increased production of truncated forms of Abeta ending at the 42 position.</p>
