          <p id="s1p1">HLA-A*6817, identified in the Kolla Amerindians of North-West Argentina possesses a novel nucleotide substitution.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Analysis of HLA polymorphism of the indigenous populations of Central and South America has identified many alleles not seen previously in other populations. We have described a novel allele, B*5113, previously in a Kolla Amerindian individual from North-West Argentina. Here we present a second novel allele from this population: A*6817, which differs from its closest neighbour A*68012 by a single substitution at nucleotide 419. This substitution of adenosine 419 A*68012 for thymidine in A*6817 results in a novel amino acid change (aspartate to valine) at residue 116.</p>
