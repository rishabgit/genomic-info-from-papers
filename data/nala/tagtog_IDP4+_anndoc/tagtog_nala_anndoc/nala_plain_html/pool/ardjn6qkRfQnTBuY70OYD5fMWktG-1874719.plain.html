          <p id="s1p1">Substitutions for glycine alpha 1-637 and glycine alpha 2-694 of type I procollagen in lethal osteogenesis imperfecta. The conformational strain on the triple helix introduced by a glycine substitution can be transmitted along the helix.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Two substitutions for glycine in the triple-helical domain were found in type I procollagen synthesized by skin fibroblasts from two probands with lethal osteogenesis imperfecta. One was a substitution of valine for glycine alpha 1-637, and the other was a substitution of arginine for glycine alpha 2-694. The effects of the mutations on the zipper-like folding of the collagen triple helix were similar, since there was post-translational overmodification of the collagenase A fragments (amino acids 1-775) but not of more COOH-terminal fragments of the protein. The mutations differed markedly, however, on their effects on thermal unfolding of the triple helix. The collagenase A fragment from the collagen containing the arginine alpha 2-694 substitution was cleaved at about amino acid 700 when incubated with trypsin at 30-35 degrees C. Therefore, there was micro-unfolding of the triple helix at a site close to the glycine substitution. Surprisingly, however, the collagenase A fragment with the valine alpha 1-637 substitution was also cleaved at about amino acid 700 under the same conditions. The results, therefore, demonstrated that although most glycine substitutions delay folding of the triple helix in regions that are NH2-terminal to the site of the substitution, the effects on unfolding can be transmitted to regions that are COOH-terminal to the site of the glycine substitution.</p>
