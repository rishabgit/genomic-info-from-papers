          <p id="s1p1">Identification of genetic variation in the human serotonin 1D beta receptor gene.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Disturbances of serotonergic pathways have been implicated in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, migraine, and substance abuse. Genetic variation in genes coding for serotonin receptor proteins might well be involved in the genetic predisposition to these diseases and/or of pharmacogenetic relevance. Genomic samples from 46 unrelated healthy subjects were investigated by single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA) to screen for genetic variation in the human serotonin 1D beta (5-HT1D beta) receptor gene. Overlapping PCR (polymerase chain reaction) fragments covered the whole coding sequence as well as 5' untranslated regions of the 5-HT1D beta gene. Four nucleotide sequence variants were found: a coding mutation in nucleotide position 371 which leads to an amino acid exchange (Phe--&gt;Cys) in position 124 of the receptor protein and three mutations in the 5' flanking region. For all mutations specific PCR-based assays were developed which allow rapid genotyping in populations and families. To our knowledge, the Phe-124-Cys substitution is the first natural occurring molecular variant which has been identified for the 5-HT1D beta receptor so far.</p>
