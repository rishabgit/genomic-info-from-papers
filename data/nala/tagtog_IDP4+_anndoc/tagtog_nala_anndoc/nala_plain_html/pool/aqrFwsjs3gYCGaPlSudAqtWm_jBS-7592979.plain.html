          <p id="s1p1">Constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 by mutation of phosphorylation sites and an A-helix motif.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">A recently described downstream target of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is the MAPK-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2 which has been shown to be responsible for small heat shock protein phosphorylation. We have analyzed the mechanism of MAPKAP kinase 2 activation by MAPK phosphorylation using a recombinant MAPKAP kinase 2-fusion protein, p44MAPK and p38/40MAPK in vitro and using an epitope-tagged MAPKAP kinase 2 in heat-shocked NIH 3T3 cells. It is demonstrated that, in addition to the known phosphorylation of the threonine residue carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain, Thr-317, activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 in vitro and in vivo is dependent on phosphorylation of a second threonine residue, Thr-205, which is located within the catalytic domain and which is highly conserved in several protein kinases. Constitutive activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 is obtained by replacement of both of these threonine residues by glutamic acid. A constitutively active form of MAPKAP kinase 2 is also obtained by deletion of a carboxyl-terminal region containing Thr-317 and the A-helix motif or by replacing the conserved residues of the A-helix. These data suggest a dual mechanism of MAPKAP kinase 2 activation by phosphorylation of Thr-205 inside the catalytic domain and by phosphorylation of Thr-317 outside the catalytic domain involving an autoinhibitory A-helix motif.</p>
