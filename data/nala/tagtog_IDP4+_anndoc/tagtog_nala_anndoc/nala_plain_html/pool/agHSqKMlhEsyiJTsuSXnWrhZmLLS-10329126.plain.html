          <p id="s1p1">Role of the human and murine cyclin T proteins in regulating HIV-1 tat-activation.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">Human cyclin T1 markedly stimulates tat-activation in rodent cells which are normally poorly responsive to the effects of Tat. This result suggests that there are likely to be critical differences in the murine and human cyclin T1 proteins. Here, we analyzed the role of the murine and human cyclin T1 proteins in addition to the human cyclin T2a and T2b proteins on regulating tat-activation. Only the human cyclin T1 protein efficiently formed a complex with Tat bound to TAR RNA. This difference in function was due to the presence of a cysteine residue in human cyclin T1 at position 261 rather than a tyrosine or asparagine residue which are found in the murine cyclin T1 protein and the human cyclin T2a and T2b proteins, respectively. A mouse cyclin T1 protein containing a substitution of tyrosine residue 261 with a cysteine residue, was able to interact with Tat and stimulate tat-transactivation in rodent cells. Likewise, substitution of a cysteine residue for an asparagine residue at position 260 of the cyclin T2a and T2b proteins also resulted in their ability to interact with Tat and stimulate tat-activation in rodent cells. The data indicate that a specific residue in the cyclin T proteins is required for their in vitro interaction with Tat and their ability to stimulate in vivo tat-activation.</p>
