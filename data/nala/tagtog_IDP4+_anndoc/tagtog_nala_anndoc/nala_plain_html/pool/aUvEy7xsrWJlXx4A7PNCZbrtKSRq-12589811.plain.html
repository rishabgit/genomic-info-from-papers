          <p id="s1p1">The interaction between ADAM 22 and 14-3-3zeta: regulation of cell adhesion and spreading.</p>
          <p id="s1p2">The ADAM family consists of a number of transmembrane proteins that contain disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase-like domains. Therefore, ADAMs potentially have cell adhesion and protease activities. 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of cytoplasmic proteins that associate with several intracellular signaling molecules in the regulation of various cellular functions. Here we report the identification of a novel interaction between the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail and the 14-3-3zeta isoform by a yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction between the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail and 14-3-3zeta was confirmed by an in vitro protein pull-down assay as well as by co-immunoprecipitation, and the binding sites were mapped to the 28 amino acid residues of the C-terminus of the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail in human SGH44 cells inhibited cell adhesion and spreading and that deletion or mutation of the binding site for 14-3-3zeta within the ADAM 22 cytoplasmic tail abolished the ability of the overexpressed cytoplasmic tail to alter cell adhesion and spreading. Taken together, these results for the first time demonstrate an association between ADAM 22 and a 14-3-3 protein and suggest a potential role for the 14-3-3zeta/ADAM 22 association in the regulation of cell adhesion and related signaling events.</p>
